When Reese is hauled into NYPD's 8th Precinct for a skirmish on  the subway, he's bailed out by a man he doesn't know: MR. FINCH (Michael  Emerson), a mysterious billionaire. Finch offers Reese a choice: stay  on the streets and drink himself to death -- or join him in his mission  to stop violent crimes before they happen. Finch has access to a secret  source of information, one that identifies people who are about to be  involved in violent crimes. There's just one catch: he doesn't know if  these people will be the victims or the perpetrators. Skeptical but  intrigued, Reese agrees to help. Together, Reese and Finch work to  discover what danger is about to befall Assistant District Attorney  DIANE HANSEN (Natalie Zea). Their actions garner the unwanted attention  of NYPD homicide detective CARTER (Taraji Henson) -- a dedicated veteran  cop who's not fond of vigilantes -- and DETECTIVE FUSCO (Kevin  Chapman), a precinct detective who stands in the way of Reese's plans.</p>","_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/28"}}},{"id":29,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/29/person-of-interest-1x02-ghosts","name":"Ghosts","season":1,"number":2,"airdate":"2011-09-29","airtime":"21:00","airstamp":"2011-09-29T21:00:00-04:00","runtime":60,"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/35/89355.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/35/89355.jpg"},"summary":"<p>FINCH (Michael Emerson) gives REESE (Jim Caviezel) another social  security number from the machine -- another chance to stop something  terrible from happening.
